# CS-370


### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
- For this project we were given the game and maze functionality, and the starting code for the neural network, in which we were tasked
with completing the training algorithm. I was able to succesfully complete the code for the Q-Training algorithm, which was the required
model.
### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

  #### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  - Computer scientist are problem solvers. We are given a task or situation by the customers, and have to come up with a solution that
  will efficiently meet all the requirements. All of these tasks are solved by creating software in a computer, and many times leverage
  technologies, libraries, and frameworks created by other computer scientists. This matters because we are living in a digital world,
  where devices are interconnected, and people have started to rely on this technologies in their daily lives.
  
  #### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  - 

  #### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
